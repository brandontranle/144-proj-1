-------
9a. Text gradients defined by var(--gradient-primary) were used on most headings of <section> elements (i.e. .section-title) and was also included in .emphasized. These gradients were made by clipping the    background into its corresponding text. 
9b. clamp() was used to make responsive typography by setting font sizes of specific elements (e.g., html, h2, p, button a, .skills-grid li, h3, .emphasized, .output ).
12. I used CSS gradients (var(--gradient-primary)) for backgrounds on section titles, the hexagon in my about section, and buttons; I also applied box-shadow and text-shadow on cards, the terminal in the hero section, and buttons to create depth; I also used CSS transforms (translateY) for hover interactions on .btn and .card; implemented gradient borders on skill-category elements using border-image.

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")
----------
1. Clicking the .menu-toggle element (i.e. hamburger menu) toggles the navigation menu by adding or removing the `active` class on the navbar / nav element and button. 
2. Similar to the feature above, clicking the "Show More Experiences" button toggles the expanded experience section by adding or removing the `expanded` class.

NOTES TO STAFF
(If there is anything you need to tell us, please use the section below)
---------------
For requirement 13: I fulfilled this query in my "Skills" section where I used a CSS grid and two device breakpoints. By default, the CSS grid has 3 columns and 3 rows, with one of them having an element (i.e. the certificates list) that spans all a row at the same time. As the page shrinks, the columns and rows will decrease by 1 until it reaches the optimal mobile dimensions (i.e. max-width:468px), where it will only showcase 1 square at a time. 

For requirement 15: I fulfilled this query by modifying an <a> element with class "logo-link", where I modified the block level display to become a flex display instead. 

For requirement 20: I made it so that when a new visitor hovers over the contact or footer links, the text will display in the --text-muted color, and once they visit the links, the text will turn --text-muted, and when hovering on the visited link, the text will turn --terminal-green. Additionally, the links will perform the "jump" animation I created when hovered on.
